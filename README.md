# bikemode

Hi All,

This Repository is created in respect of a mobile app, where you can select a bike mode on and select a contact 
and if they call you then the call automatically get hung up and the selected contact recieve the text.

I have extended the BroadcastReceiver to detect the incoming call programitically.
I have used SMSManager API to send the SMS.
